            <div id="page-content">

                <p><b>Jamaal Dublin Jr.</b></p>
                <p><i>January 31st 2023</i></p>

                <p><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2911666/?ref_=tttr_tr_tt">John Wick</a></em> is about an ex-hit-man that has his puppy killed and car stole in an
                home evasion at the start of the movie and he's forced to come out of retirement and hunt down the men who robbed him for revenge because the puppy that they
            killed was a gift from his wife that had recently died and it was her last gift to him. The reason I enjoy the movie is because of the fighting scenes and the thrill
        throughtout it, while he's searching for the men he has a huge bounty put on his head that was sent to everyone in the city he's in which makes the film even more exciting
    and suspenseful. </p>
